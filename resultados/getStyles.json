The Scratch #11 recipe originates from Chrisâ€™ stint at Englandâ€™s University of Sunderland brewing program. After returning to Colorado the brothers drew on Chrisâ€™ experience and brewed pilot batches tweaking that recipe. The ESB production recipe has direct bloodlines to these pilot batches.\r\n\r\nThe Thames Valley ale yeast and the roasted barley create a biscuit flavor with nutty undertones. Combining these flavors with the earthiness of East Kent Golding hops creates one hell of a fine session beer. Take in the deep mahogany beauty of this beer and breathe in the full hoppy nose. Itâ€™s not the ESB, but itâ€™s damn special.",

Hedonistic!\"Mellow Beer Emboldened by Hops,\" Elaine Louies article in the New York TimesDining Out Section, (March 24, 1999) announced the release of latest Rogue elixir to be bottled. The article states that \"The newest beer of Rogue Ales sounds more aggressive than it is. Brutal Bitter is actually full-bodied, deeply flavored, intensely hoppy brew. There is nothing brutal about the rich, deep, mellow taste. Its crackling but not sharp... This beer may raise eyebrows, but it wont pucker lips. The aftertaste is clean.\"\r\n\r\nRogue brewer John Maier describes his Brutal Bitter as a cross between a Very Extra Special Bitter and an Indian Pale Ale. Brutal Bitter was first brewed in 1996 for the 20th Anniversary of the Horse Brass Pub in Portland. Customer demand prompted Rogue to continue brewing Brutal for the Horse Brass as well as using it as Rogues premier pour at the 1998 Oregon Brewers Festival. At the 1999 SpringFest in Portland, Oregon, Brutal Bitter was unscientifically voted the Peoples Choice--it received twice as many votes as the runner-up.\r\n\r\nBrutal combines Oregon hops with English Malts. The Oregon grown Crystal hop is a triploid variety developed from the German Hallertau aroma hop variety with contributions from Cascade, Brewers Gold, and Early Green. Crystal is the only hop used in brewing Brutal and it provides a massive amount of aroma without dry-hopping. The English malts used are floor malted Pipkin (a mellow cross of Maris Otter and Warboys, from an English company called Beeston), Cara Vienna and Cara Wheat. Brutal Bitter is packaged in Rogues classic 22 ounce silk-screened bottle, 12-ounce 6-pack (new for 2005), and is available on draft.",

This is difficult for modern style wiennies to grasp. How can one style be so many things? How can I judge it good or bad?. The current Brewery Creek Dark Mild is medium brown, soft hops and about 3.5% abv. It could be a bit more estery. It is a lovely style.",

Since that time, Hibernation has become the most sought-after winter beer in Colorado. Hibernationâ€™s massive flavors are so intense that it requires over three months of aging each year. Each summer, while our brewers are still spending their weekends in flip-flops and shorts, they prepare for Julyâ€™s Hibernation brewing schedule.\r\n\r\nWe cellar Hibernation until late October, when it reaches the peak of perfection. This lengthy aging process gives Hibernation its revered malty richness, complex hop profile and hearty warming character, which is perfect right out of the bottle or cellared for longer periods of time. Hibernation is a lively treat that really beats the winter chill. This scrumptious, collectible, and imminently cellarable ale is only available for six weeks each year, from November 1 to December 15.  Hibernation Ale is the perfect gift or accompaniment to your winter festivities.",

You can find dry stouts, milk stouts, Imperial stouts, American stouts, and even stouts made with oats.\r\n\r\nAt the Church Brew Works we have crafted delicious Toasted Oatmeal Stout.  The oats were blended with the best barley malt we have â€“ and we didnâ€™t stop there.  To give this beer a wonderful roasted flavor, we added unmalted, very darkly roasted barley.  The roasted barley is mixed with a generous portion of chocolate colored malt giving the Blast Furnace Stout a beautiful ruby hue.\r\n\r\nWe used our finest hops unsparingly to create a delicately balanced bitterness with a rich roastiness and fresh hop aroma. The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink.\r\n\r\nA typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.  Ours, though not typical, does have a welcome medium body.  As you drink this beer, notice the rich, creamy brown head.  Drink it slowly and savor the flavors.  We donâ€™t think you will be disappointed.  Beer is not just for breakfast anymore.",

They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.\r\n\r\nSome stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer), a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19.\r\n\r\nSo for your amusement (and our final relief), we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff.

Strong beliefs, independent thinking and an unwavering commitment to his family and his people earned him a reputation as a man of integrity and courage.  In 1832, along with 1,200 of his people, Black Hawk was driven from his ancestral home during a war that bears his name.  We celebrate this Sauk leader and his courage with our BlackHawk Porter, the kind of beer that make you say, Ma-ka-tai-she-kia-kiak!\r\n\r\nChief BlackHawk Porter is a robust black and sharply bittersweet ale.  This style was traditionally the session beer consumed by the porters in London.",

Deep brown with mahogany highlights, the hops and malt are very well balanced leaving one to contemplate the myriad of flavors as the beer warms. Moderate to slightly heavy, this beer is heaven in a glass.",

However we are still using the same Faitrade Araba Bourbon beans from Rwandaâ€™s Abuhuzamugambi Bakawa Co-operative.\r\n\r\nAt the Meantime Brewing Co we love flavour, so it wasnâ€™t exactly difficult for us to see how the scents and aromas of coffee and barley would create a perfect match like just like mint and lamb, toffee and banana, peaches and cream, peanut butter and jam. Serve lightly chilled with as many chocolate truffles as your conscience allows.\r\n\r\nEach serving is equal to one cup of coffee",

It's an assertive but deftly balanced beer (somewhere between an American pale ale and an India Pale Ale) brewed with hefty amounts of European malts and American hops.\r\n\r\nIt features a merengue-like head, a copper color, and a hoppy nose, thanks to a big post-boil addition of Centennial hops. To complement its hoppy first impression, Dale's also sports a rich middle of malts and hops, and a bracing finish. Dale's is 6.5% alcohol by volume, and features 65 International Bittering Units.\r\n\r\nWe think of it as the perfect, everyday beer for hopheads like us. Dale's Pale Ale's rich flavor has helped us make many new fans, and its numerous honors have helped us kick huge holes in the misconceptions regarding cans.",

        "descript": "For the 28th session of the Harpoon 100 Barrel Series, weâ€™re celebrating this yearâ€™s hop harvest with Glacier Harvest Wet Hop beer, a pale ale made with fresh Glacier hops.\r\n \r\nWet hop beers are brewed using fresh, â€œwetâ€ hops instead of traditional dried hopsâ€”hops contain about 60% moisture when they are first picked.\r\n\r\nTypically, when hops are picked they are quickly dried and refrigerated to increase shelf life and make them more consistent for brewing. Freshly picked wet hops, however, need to be used within hours of harvest or they will begin to degrade rapidly. Wet hops retain more of their natural aroma and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This gives wet hop beers a fresher hop flavor and aroma than that of beers hopped with processed hops.\r\nThis yields an immersed, intense hop flavor in the beer.\r\n\r\nHarpoon brewer Ray Dobens, creator of the beer, added a heroic dose of fresh hops the day of the harvest.The hop flavor and aroma from this copper-colored ale comes from a generous late addition of freshly harvested â€œwetâ€ hops.",

Inversion I.P.A.'s trio of American hops delivers an over-the-top nose with hints of orange and grapefruit.  Inversion is then dry-hopped for seven days resulting in an added hoppy kick.  To balance the hop character, Deschutesâ€™ brewers used crystal and caraston malts that weave throughout the beer providing soft, complex caramel flavors. \r\n\r\nJust like clear days up on the mountain, Inversion I.P.A. will deliver a path to higher ground.  Inversion I.P.A. is a phenomenal NW-style I.P.A., beckoning all beer drinkers and enticing I.P.A. lovers to invert their world and find clarity above the routine of the everyday.",

This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.\r\n\r\nBritish troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\r\n\r\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.\r\n\r\nBig Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop head.",

This contributes to the higher alcohol content as well. \r\nWhen India was part of the British Empire, pale ale shipped to the troops would often spoil due to the rough voyage and temperature extremes. The brewers had a theory that if they loaded the beer with extra hops, the hops would preserve the beer. Of course, this added significantly to the beerâ€™s flavor and aroma. When the troops returned to Britain, they had become \"hop-heads\", appreciating the beauty of the hop \"over-influence\". Regular pale ale was simply not enough anymore! A new beer style, India Pale Ale, had been created: an aggressively hoppy and now quite happy to be home pale ale.",

Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice.

We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hopsâ€¦ Which are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront, but strides at a steady pace, and finishes balanced. The signature characteristic of the Tiger is the aromaâ€¦ we use massive quantities of whole East Kent Goldings hops to dry hop in our conditioning tanks. The result? The essential oils from the hops are an enticing treat before every sip. Notice the lacing of stripes around the pint glass as you finish your glass; itâ€™s the mark of the Tiger.",

        "descript": "This beauty is a complete work of art! Bryan and I picked 22 lbs of fresh Cascade hops from 3 gigantic hop vines Bryan has at his house. Hops produce an overabundance of hop cones and we were there for the picking. Even after 22 lbs, we hardly put a dent in the yield! So...here we are 3 weeks later, the beer is on tap and it is the freshest...hoppiest...flavorful beer you can imagine! Needless to say, we are proud of this beauty from the ground, up! We wanted a full-flavored IPA, so Bryan suggested we use our Requiem IPA recipe, and calculate for fresh, whole hop cones. Worked beautifully!! We ended up with an IPA with so much up-front flavor you would think you are enjoying a high octane Imperial! Instead, this is a middle-of-the-road IPA, at 5.2% abv!! This just goes to show how a hugely flavorful IPA can be loaded-up with fresh ingredients and come out the other end, a tasty LOW octane, treat! Bryan and I hope you get to stop in soon to try this one out! We decorated Bube's with some of the actual hop vines we pulled from. For the true hophead, you will be in heaven. And for the all-around beer enthusiasts, we hope you can appreciate the creativity in this beer. I know I'm proud to say I had a hand in this one!!",

All the hops in the beer are grown naturally on the premises of our brewery in Chico. We pick the hops ourselves and then take them directly to the brew kettle, without being dried, just after picking so they retain nearly all of their natural oils and resins. It is made with Cascade, Centennial and Chinook hops. Until now, this beer has only been available in draft. Starting this year, we will be bottling it on a very limited basis, with plans to expand its availability as we expand our Chico hop field in the coming years.",

        "descript": "Portsmouth is a colonial era seaport town, so it goes to follow that sooner or later we'd brew an India Pale Ale as a tribute to those big, hoppy 19th century ales that made the long sea voyage from England's temperate shores, 'round the Cape of Good Hope, to the sultry climes of the faraway East Indies.\r\n\r\nBut there's another reason we brewed this beer, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads. \r\n\r\nTen years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: â€œWhy don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?â€\r\n\r\nYou could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think theyâ€™ll be quite pleased.",

The rest of the hop additions are blended at different IBU's (International Bittering Units) in groups of three hops per addition in order to create more hop complexity. At CCB, we love hops but also feel that balance is important for IPAs. So Jai Alai features a sturday caramel malt component which helps to create balance, staving off hop astringency. Ultimately, Jai Alai is a very strong interpretation of a single American IPA.

Brewed  with Simcoe hops, developed and trademarked by Select Botanicals Group, LLC, in the year 2000. This hybrid hops was created to allow maximum aromatic oils, along with low cohumulone(harshness) levels, so that brewers can really load up a lot of 'em in a beer and not have any harshness. The piney, citrusy notes are all here, and in a very clean (non-harsh) way, as well as having an aroma with impact. Introduced by Weyerbacher in 2005 originally as a seasonal, this brew has garnered numbers so high on Beer Advocate, and been in such high demand by consumers,  we decided to add it to our year-round line-up in March 2007. Check it out, and you'll soon see why everyone's talking about it.",

Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the â€œnever settleâ€ philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last yearâ€™s monument to hops.\r\n\r\nHead Brewer Brett Porter says, â€œThis is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.â€ In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.\r\n\r\nThe team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.\r\n\r\nLimited Availability April through June.\r\n\r\nDonâ€™t miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.\r\n\r\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Bond+Street+Series/default.aspx\r\n\r\nAvailable April through June.\r\n\r\nHop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.\r\n\r\nAlcohol By Volume: 8.1%\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIBU 95\r\n\r\nWhen one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nphoto: chris mather\r\nRatings, Awards & Notables\r\n\r\nWorld's Best Strong Pale Ale (Imperial IPA)\r\n2007 World Beer Awards\r\n\r\nWorld's 50 Best Beers\r\n2006 International Beer Challenge\r\n\r\nGold Medal, 92 Points\r\n2006 World Beer Championships\r\n\r\nSilver Medal, India Pale Ale Category\r\n2006 Australian International Beer Awards\r\n\r\nModern Brewery Age, February 12, 2007\r\n5 out 5 stars \r\nHop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to â€œImperial IPAâ€ status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.\r\nâ€œThis one is lovely,â€ said taster Tom Conti. â€œThey got it just right.â€\r\nIt pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. â€œThey sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[thereâ€™s] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,â€ one taster observed.\r\nIn addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.\r\nThis was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. â€œThis is a beautiful beer,â€ concluded taster Gregg Glaser. â€œFull of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.â€\r\nâ€œNot for the timid,â€ said taster Robert Lachman.\r\n\r\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/BrewPub/OnTap/125352.aspx",

We make it with six different malts and three types of hops, then dry-hop it with a mutha lode of Amarillo hops. It is 8.7% alcohol by volume, and has 85 International Bittering Units. \r\n\r\nIt features a gooey, resiny aroma and a luscious mouthfeel. Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.\r\n\r\nWe brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Coloradoâ€™s first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.\r\n\r\nOriginally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.\r\n\r\n--http://www.oskarblues.com/brew/",

Our Stone 10th Anniversary Ale weighs in at 10% alcohol by volume (perfect for a 10th anniversary beer), and has a little more color and malt character than our other IPAs. In addition to using the new Summit hop variety in the brewhouse to provide the powerful bitterness, we went back through our records and found some of our favorite hops over the years, and used them to flavor this brew, including Chinook, Crystal, and large doses of Simcoe in the dry-hop to provide a huge, complex, piney, fruity and floral hop character.

There are five different hop additions that were carefully planed out to impart just enough bitterness to give it the body and depth that it needed without leaving you with the astringent and bitter aftertaste. We then added a plethora of English flavor and aroma hops that round out the floral and citrus esters. With the beer being so well balanced between bitter and sweet, we than added \"big sacks\" of bittering hops to the conditioning vessel to impart all the wonderful citrus and floral notes deep into the beer while leaving the bittering aspects of the hop behind.

This beer demonstrates a unique balance of malt-inspired, delicate red grapefruit sweetness and lingering hop dryness. The OG and final ABV provide the structure and body to balance the harmony of distinct flavours. Cascade, Warrior, Summit and Glacier Hops are used for bittering and Cascade Hops are added for dry hopping after fermentation. This hop blend is well balanced with Malted Wheat, Pale Ale, Crystal, and Caramalt Malts. To fully enjoy all the flavours, this ale is best drunk at 55 degrees Fahrenheit. This beer pairs well with Cajun dishes, blackened fish, and BBQ. XXXX draws its name from the British brewing convention of using Xâ€™s to denote style. 70 BUâ€™s, 1.092 OG, 9.25% ABV.",

New malting techniques led to the development of pale malt, a barley malt kilned at low temperatures which contributed very little colour to the finished beer.

Plenty of British Crystal malt in the grist lends this ale its rich colour, its caramel maltiness, and adds the occasional whiff of toffee to the nose. An addition of American and German hops to the kettle at the end of the boil is used to suffuse our Pale Ale with a gently spicy hop finish.",

The most famous examples are brewed in Burton on Trent.  This hard water gives these beer a pleasantly dry bitter finish, hence the name \"bitter.\"  A brewery usually brews several bitters of various alcohol strengths.  The lowest in alcohol (and usually flavor) is called \"bitter\" or \"ordinary bitter.\"  A step up in alcohol and hop character gives us \"best bitter\" or \"special bitter.\"  Finally a beer is made that is full of hop aroma and flavor, has a maltiness to match, and a generous amount of alcohol is called an \"extra special bitter\" or E.S.B.\r\n\r\nAlthough inspired by the British Ales  Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale uses distinctive American hops, which give not only the crisp bitterness to balance the malt, but also a hint of floral aroma. We brew Calico Amber Ale with 100% malt and use 4 different malts to give it a rich complexity.  The blend of crystal  malts give it flavors including toffee and caramel.  A blend of American Cascade and Centennial hops provide a counterpoint to the malt.  Finally our proprietary yeast provides a fruity background and a Madeira like richness that rounds out this gold medal winning ale.",

Share it with your family over the holiday dinner. Lay a few down, aging only helps a barley wine develop more class. At 11.1 % ABV (alcohol by volume) this fine ale will keep for years. Our expected maximum shelf-life is 2 to 3 years. Although it might see a decade, beyond the 3rd year most barley-wines have a tendency to decrease in complexity, so don't wait too long",

The June/July 1998 issue of Mens Journal included Rogue Ales Shakespeare Stout as one of \"The 100 Best Things to Eat in America.\"Based on Stuart Kallens book, \"The 50 Best Beers in the World\", Shakespeare Stout was ranked the third best beer in the world and best American Beer--which makes it the Worlds Best Stout!\r\n\r\nRogues Shakespeare Stout is ebony in color, a rich creamy head and a mellow chocolate aftertaste.

Guinness use Nitrogen mixed with carbon dioxide to dispense their stout which adds to the creamy mouth-feel. BTW: The \"Imported\" Guinness you buy here in the US comes from Canada.

In addition to the nibs, lactose was added at the end of the boil to give a little sweetness in the body. The addition of Galena and Simcoe hops lends a subtle fruity balance. After primary fermentation, the beer was aged for three weeks on a blend of cocoa nibs and Ugandan vanilla beans.\r\n\r\nDubbed Cocaoabunga, this unfiltered beer has a pleasant cocoa aroma, a subtle sweetness in the mouthfeel, a full-bodied flavor, and hints of vanilla.

Quite robust and roasty on the palate, Old Heathen imperial stout has a wonderfully fruity nose and a moderately dry finish. The taste is highly complex- perhaps you'll even discern notes of espresso or chocolate. \r\n\r\nOld Heathen imperial stout is our interpretation of a beer style that originated in the 18th century. Brewed in England and exported to Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, these beers became fashionable among the members of the Czar's court. In order to survive long voyages they were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.0% ABV (alcohol by volume) Old Heathen definitely contains a warming belt. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation- this beer keeps well and will only get better with age.\r\n\r\nLike most of our beers, Weyerbacher Old Heathen is a perfect accompaniment to foods. Try it with rich stews, oysters, caviar or roasted meats. Old Heathen is also a perfect companion to chocolate desserts.\r\n\r\nOld Heathen is now available year-round.",

The taste starts with chocolate malt with a hint of spice and rolls into a warm spicy alcohol taste which has the effect of creating the balance that usually comes from the hop bitter.  There is some hop bitter on the finish, but not much.  Overall, this beer finishes relatively dry for such a big beer.

Perhaps UFOâ€™s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head.  The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO.  Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing.  When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.\r\n\r\nThe aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character.  This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon.  The lemon accentuates the yeastâ€™s fruity, tart fragrance.  UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body.  The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor.  UFO has a clean finish.  Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.\r\n\r\nThe overall character is a cloudy appearance with a citrus-like aroma, light body, and clean finish.  Serve with a lemon.\"",

The yeast used for this brew also imparts its unique spicy, clovey flavour. Some people even detect a light banana flavour.

Allay your fears my friends because Iâ€™m going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.  The remaining yeast contributes flavor, adds B vitamins, and improves the beer as it ages.",

To be true to the style, Merry Monks' Ale is bottle conditioned. This means we add a bit of sugar and yeast just prior to bottling. This imparts a special effervescence to the beer, a creamier carbonation, and also extends the shelf life. The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation. We suggest storing at cellar temperatures -around 55 degrees F- and away from light.\r\n\r\nWhen you try this beer you're in for a unique treat. The special effervescence and creaminess are immediately apparent when pouring. The Pilsner malts combined with the Belgian yeast strains  yield a remarkable and complex flavor- perhaps you'll note subtle hints of fruit or spice. The flavor is nicely balanced and the finish moderate to dry , begging for the next sip.\r\n\r\nYou might ask why we go through all this trouble and expense for just a beer, but one taste and you'll know the Merry Monks' Ale (9.3% ABV) will more than complement any meal it accompanies. Enjoyed best around 48 degrees F, it also makes a fine after-dinner drink.",

        "descript": "Belgian Wits originated in Belgium, in the area of Brabant just east of Brussels. This are was a part of the Netherlands in the early 1800's and was the wheat growing region. In this era, the Dutch basically controlled the spice trade, thus, coriander as well as Curacao orange peel made its way into the beer. Spices were used well before the widespread use of hops in beer. At one point there were more than thirty breweries producing a Wit, but overtime the style died off and in 1954 the last of the breweries ceased operations. One of the most famous brands of Belgian Wits is Hoegaarden (pronounced \"Who Garden\") produced by Pierre Celis back in 1966. This revived the style and by the 1980's it was popular again!\r\n\r\nBelgian Wits are similar to a Hefeweizen with respect to the cloudiness of the beer and some phenolic (clove) and tart flavors. Wits should have white, rocky head when poured and should be almost white in appearance, hence the name. \r\n\r\nYou will smell oranges and coriander which is different than a Hefeweizen that smells of banana and clove.

A special yeast gives a refreshing tangy flavor that is different from both the sour Weiss beers of Berlin or the banana and clovey Weizens of Bavaria. The mild hopping allows the unique malts to show through and does not conflict with the subtleties of the citrus spicing. This unique citrus character is created by adding a blend of curacao (bitter orange), sweet orange and coriander to the boil.

The finish is dry and satisfying. Hazy yellow golden colour. Lemon custard, lime zest, and delicate spice melange aromas. Well-balanced, a frothy entry leads to a dryish medium body of nuts, baked oranges, and slightly phenolic mineral flavors. Finishes with a metallic ore dust, salt, and dried lemon fade. This beer is certified as organic.",

The cherries are soaked for months in slightly bitter ale before being blended into the beer. Quelque Chose is made with dark roasted malts, and the end result is something commonly known as an authentic nectar. The most original of the Unibroue line, it is highly appreciated by winter-sports enthusiasts.",

They also bring some cloudiness to the brew, but don't be afraid!  Hopped with Styrian Goldings and finished with Saaz, this beer has a noticable hoppy dryness which makes it a fine thirst quencher, something the original Farmhouse Ales were intended to be, served to workers out in the fields on hot summer days as a restorative.\r\nFermented with Forbidden Fruit yeast, at a very high temperature (78F), the spiciness developed is entirely from this traditional yeast strain, not from any kettle additions.

In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a \"black Pils,\" but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.\r\n\r\nIn a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass.",

Samuel Adams Boston LagerÂ® also uses only the finest of ingredients including two row barley, as well as German Noble aroma hops. The exclusive use of two row barley not only imparts a full, smooth body but also gives the beer a wide spectrum of malt flavor ranging from slightly sweet to caramel to slightly roasted. The Noble hops varieties, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, add a wide range of floral, piney and citrus notes, which are present from the aroma, through the flavor, to the lingering smooth finish. We take great pride in the Noble hops used in our beers. They are hand selected by Jim Koch and our other brewers from the world's oldest hops growing area. Among the world's most expensive, they cost twenty times as much as other hops.",

It took four batches to get it just right. John used acidulated malts imported from Europe to get the crisp, lemony/apple flavor the McAleese Brothers wanted. The bottle label reflects the McAleese family heritage, puctures the Kells Irish Pub logo, and a traditional Irish flutist. \r\n\r\nThe first Kells Irish Pub opened in Seattle in October 1983 in Post Alley, above the historic Pike Place Market. The restaurant will remind you of the Old Country with its warm, cozy atmosphere and traditional surroundings. Theres also a patio outside thats a great place to feel the breeze from the Puget Sound and the buzz from the Market. Kells has Seattles largest selection of Single Malt Scotch. \r\n\r\nThe Kells Irish Pub in Portland is a local landmark and has been named the #1 Irish Entertainment venue in America.

        "descript": "Negra Modelo has long been the dark beer alternative for Mexican beer drinkers. It has been identified as one of the few surviving examples of Vienna style lager - a style that was largely replaced in European breweries with Oktoberfest, a slightly lighter lager, in the early twentieth century. \r\nNegra Modelo pours with an off-white, medium head. The body is clear with a rich amber/copper color. The aroma is sweet with hints of apple. The impression at the first sip is sweet. This gives way only a bit to some hops bitterness which gives some balance but leaves the beer firmly in the sweet category. It has no real lager snap at the end, just lingering hops. This actually makes the second sip more balanced than the first.\r\n\r\nThere is some complexity and depth here but the flavors are very delicate. They are obliterated by the aggressive flavors of the Mexican food that Modelo is often served with making it a sweet balance to the savory and sometimes hot cuisine.",

We then gingerly scatter some very light floral hops at the beginning to give it some esters and sweetness that compliment the watermelon. The true magic of this beer does not occur in the brewing process but in the conditioning vessel. This is where we add the best farm fresh local watermelon and than push the beer into it, allowing it to sit and saturate for a few weeks. By the time it is complete, we are left with a unbelievably smooth tasting beer with a beautiful aroma and subtle taste of watermelon that imparts its way into this already crisp lager.

Our first brew of this light and refreshing beer was in the summer of 1984.\r\n\r\nAnchor Summer is an all-malt beer, and over 50% of its malt comes from malted wheat. It is fermented with a Triticum aestivum, AKA wheat traditional top-fermenting \"ale\" yeast because we prefer the clean flavors developed by this yeast. We believe that this style best celebrates the refreshingly light flavor of malted wheat. You may notice that the head on this beer is unusually abundant, with a consistency similar to whipped egg whites. This is due to protein contributed by the wheat.\r\n\r\nThe brewers at Anchor are proud to have revived not only rich hearty dark beers, but also this light crisp style of a modern American wheat beer.\r\n\r\nSummer getaway Wheat malt contributes to an unusual lightness and dryness to the palate, and thisâ€”combined with the distinctive flavor of the wheatâ€”makes for a perfect thirst-quenching beverage. It is the ideal drink for beer lovers who appreciate tradition and character in their beer, but also seek a lighter, refreshing style, perfect for warm weather.\r\n\r\n-http://www.anchorbrewing.com/beers/summerbeer.htm",

Nine years ago, we began our quest to provide beer lovers with a worthy fruit beer, by rolling out Wild Raspberry Ale.

We steadfastly refuse to fall prey to extracts and cheap syrups. Sure, squirting syrup into a keg of beer and rolling it around on the floor is easy, but the taste is...  fake! Over the past nine years, we have stayed true to our commitment to real fruit, no matter what the time, expense, or late season frosts have thrown our way. One year, Mother Nature delivered a late cold snap that was so severe, we had to pre-order 85% of the harvestable U.S. black raspberry crop, just to meet the demand for Wild Raspberry Ale.\r\n\r\nOur efforts do not go unrewarded â€“ Wild Raspberry Ale is a truly effervescent, ruby red ale that achieves the almost impossible balance between malted barley and tart raspberry fruitiness. Its naturally tart character makes Wild Raspberry the ultimate accompaniment to spicy Mexican food or on its own as a stand-alone session beer.",

The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And the beer pour is always rightâ€” temperature, glass, presentation. \r\n\r\nâ€œNo hops were harmed in the brewing of this beer.â€ \r\n\r\nGruit is an old styleâ€”one that incorporates spices, herbs and fruit but no hops. The latter detail makes this style very rare in modern times. CafÃ© Amsterdamâ€™s Gruit is dark, strong and interesting. This combination of pale and dark malts, sage, thyme, cinnamon, black peppercorn and fresh orange peel composes distinctive, substantial flavors that meld together wonderfully. And at 12% ABV, this cellar-friendly ale is ready to lay you down! Thoroughly enjoy this old-world beer now but stash some away for later dwelvings. \r\n\r\nAvailability: \r\nAK - 22-oz bottles (limited release begins 05/29/2009)",

It was designed to be enjoyed during the holiday season. \r\n\r\nWhen you bring a glass of this dark copper ale to your lips to take your first sip you will notice the aroma of cinnamon.  There is no aromatic hop added that might overpower the distinct spice scent.  The medium body of this beer is formed from caramel and pale malts.  These create enough body to support the spices without making the beer excessively rich.  Bittering hops are added to counter the sweetness of the malt and spice.  The finish of the beer is a blend of cinnamon and nutmeg.  The combination of these two spices results in a balanced, pumpkin-pie flavor. \r\n\r\nThe overall character is a smooth, medium bodied ale spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg",

Later, when monasteries produced the local brew, winter ales were made each year to commemorate the birth of Christ. Back then, winter ales were brewed full-bodied as a source of nutrition for the upcoming winter months. Today, winter ales are typified by their seasonality, their rich, malty flavors and by their deep, dark coloration.\r\n\r\nGenerally available November-March, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is the perfect libation for a winter meal, with good friends, or beside a warm fire fending off a cold winter night.",

(Boy, letâ€™s hope thatâ€™s snoring.) The variety of toys with realistic sound effects? Fruit cake?\r\n\r\nDundee Festive Ale may be one of the few exceptions. One sip of the carefully matched seasonal spices and you realize that the holidays are worth paying...waiting for.\r\n\r\nOh, there may be one other thing to be festive about. Thereâ€™s a 13 to 1 chance against your brother in-lawâ€™s plane leaving on time. But at least thereâ€™s a chance.\r\n\r\nFestively hearty and full bodied with a mild nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and orange peel spice character and subtle crystal malt flavor.",
